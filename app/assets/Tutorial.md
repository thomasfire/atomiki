# Tutorial

This tutorial shows the basic rules of the `atomiki` game.

## Description

The game consists of two fields: your own (at the top) and your competitor’s (at the bottom). Players can place atoms
according to the rules, emit _electrons_ from a gun, and register if the electron passes back through one of the
_detectors_. The detectors are located in the same position as their respective guns. The **goal** of the game is to guess the
maximum number of your competitor’s atoms while making your competitor ~~suffer~~ guess fewer atoms than you.

## Rules

1. Only two players to a game.
2. One move at a time, fellas.
3. Games will go on as long as they have to
4. Once electron is emitted, it will go straight unless it encounters obstacle.
5. Electron bounces from _perpendicular_ atomic field, taking its direction.
6. Electron disappears once it encounters atomic field, which has opposite direction.
7. Electron gets registered once it encounters detector/gun.
8. Atoms' fields cannot collide with other fields, atoms and detectors/guns.
9. The game ends once any of the players hits _Finish_. Other player may enjoy last even move and guess competitor atoms.

## Create a new game

Press `New game` and settings you want to play. 
Once you choose the settings, press `Start game`, after which you will be shown a game ID.
Share it with you competitor in your favorite way and wait until he joins you.

## Join a game

Your competitor invited you for a duel and threw a link with game ID to you.
Open it, and you will automatically enter the game.

## Next steps

1. Place atoms according to the rules, 
   so that it will be tricky for your competitor to guess its locations.
2. Start the game and wait for competitor.
3. Make moves by pressing the guns when it is your turn.
4. Check if or where electron is being registered by detectors.
5. Given this information, guess where the atoms can be located.
6. Once done enough moves to guess atoms, finish the game.
